NLP Project Round 2 by init_3 consisting of Ajitesh Saxena(18ucs137), Siddhant Bhatnagar(18ucs138) and Kushagra Chaturvedy(18ucs229).

The tasks for the project were as follows:

Part 1:

1. Find the nouns and verbs in both the novels. Get the categories that these words fall under in the WordNet.

2. Get the frequency of each category for each noun and verb in their corresponding hierarchies and plot a histogram for the same for each novels.

Part 2:

1. Recognise all Persons, Locations, Organisations. This will be done in two steps: (1) Recognise all the entities; (2) Recognise all entity types. Use performance measures to measure the performance of the method used.

2. For evaluation you take a considerable number of random passages from the Novel, do a manual labelling, and then compare your result with it. Present the accuracy.

Part 3:

1. Extract the relationship between the entities (mainly the characters involved in the novel) as much as possible.
